# 🖼️✨ Text-to-Image Generator (Multimodal AI App)

Welcome to the **Text-to-Image Generator**, a lightweight yet powerful **multimodal AI application** built using Python that converts natural language prompts into high-quality images.  
This project demonstrates the end-to-end workflow of building an AI-powered generative system — prompt handling, model inference, and image generation — all inside a clean, single-file architecture (`app.py`).

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This application allows users to enter any text description and instantly generates an AI-created image based on that prompt.  
It leverages a **state-of-the-art text-to-image model** capable of understanding context, style, and fine-grained details.

---

## ✨ Key Highlights

- Fully built in **one single file (`app.py`)**
- Simple & clean code structure for easy understanding
- Beginner-friendly yet demonstrates real-world GenAI workflow
- High-quality AI-generated images
- Ready to integrate into larger multimodal pipelines

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **User enters a text prompt**
2. The prompt is passed to an AI text-to-image generation model
3. The model processes the input, interprets semantics, and generates a visual output
4. The resulting image is displayed or saved locally
